# Artist Discography App

## Project's Description

This is my second individual project while learning iOS development through
an online learning platform [Dicoding](dicoding.com). I developed this
application and submit it as my final project. I displayed the album
discography of a South Korean girl group, Red Velvet.

Users can view Red Velvet's whole discography throughout their career. Users
can also get to know the information of each album released.

**Tech stack**: Swift, SwiftUI
